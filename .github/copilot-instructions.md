This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript web app that displays a map with locations from a list of addresses. Use React-Leaflet for mapping functionality. Fetch and parse address data from https://bonocompramalvarrosa.com/comercios-adheridos/?f=a, geocode addresses, and display them as markers on the map.
